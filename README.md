This Unity project allows you to build an AR car configurator app for mobile devices. Users can see a 3D car model in the real world through their phone's camera (AR). They can then interact with the car by rotating it, changing its view, and even customizing its color. 
The project includes pre-made assets, scripts for AR interaction and car manipulation, and instructions for setting up AR Foundation, building the app, and using it on your phone.
